# A nucleation distance sets the cell size-dependent P-body assembly
## Introduction
Here are models we used in our paper [A nucleation distance sets the cell size-dependent P-body assembly](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.08.663506v1).  We develop a conceptual framework that models phase-separation nucleation. 

As shown in the [Paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.08.663506v1), We find that small cells contain fewer but larger P-bodies, whereas large cells form more but smaller granules. Monte Carlo simulations of P-body nucleation accurately recapitulate these cell size-dependent patterns and reveal a nucleation distance of 2.2 Âµm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that increasing vacuolar volume reduces the effective cytoplasmic space and correspondingly raises P-body number, although cell size remains the dominant determinant.

This is the model visualization for "model_without_nuclear". To test whether simple geometric constraints could explain the empirically observed scaling, we implemented a Monte Carlo simulation based on nucleation.

This figure demonstrates the procedural steps undertaken by the model during execution.
